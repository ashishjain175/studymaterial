Bastion Host

Do not assign public IP to internal server
tag your bastion host 
tag your database server
NAT Gateway - acts as a proxy to allow internal server to access internet without allowing all traffic - download patches and updates

Internet user will only see NAT Gateway IP as public IP for the database host


BGP allows for dynamic routing as Site to Site VPN requires manual updation for each subnet range


Big Data Notes

Dataproc

Batchdata use case
 -- hadoop - 90s cluster spin  up
HDFS and Map Reduce

Native integration between Hadoop and Google Cloud Storage
Hadoop Cluster can be shutdown and it just costs to run a job and not for maintaing the entire cluster.

spark
pyspark
pig
hyp

No access to master node.

Replace hdfs with gcs and migrate data to GCS

Dataflow - ETL No Ops service
Jobs are written in Java or Python

Streaming Data yse case (Can be used for Batch Process too)

Pub/Sub - at least one time message deliver. Used for ingestion

Storage : BigQuery -near real time or Bigtable - real time

Analysis - BigQuery - MachineLearning

Ingestion -- ETL -- Storage -- Analyze -- reports


Problem Statement 1#

A customer has a global ecommerce website with expansion in Asia, Europe and US.
Recommend them to build a Highly Available and Loosely coupled architecture.


Recommendation : 

Global Load Balancer 

Three Managed Groups - with each having a web server in an auto scaling group

Cross Region
Pub/Sub for Ingestion - Order Processing

DataFlow - Transform and load the data

Scalable Solution and the workload is predictable and Real time - Cloud Spanner (Expensive)




GSuite Setup

Domain Ownership Required
Business Name
Number of Emp
User Details
Define the Admin User - Becomes the Organizational Admin

Start Setup

Verify your identity and Domain
Setup Mail Server
Create MX records for Mail Exchange
