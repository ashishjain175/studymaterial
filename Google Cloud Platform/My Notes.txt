Bastion Host

Do not assign public IP to internal server
tag your bastion host 
tag your database server
NAT Gateway - acts as a proxy to allow internal server to access internet without allowing all traffic - download patches and updates

Internet user will only see NAT Gateway IP as public IP for the database host


BGP allows for dynamic routing as Site to Site VPN requires manual updation for each subnet range
